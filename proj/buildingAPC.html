      <p>
        PC building is one of those subjects that are really hard to explain to
        someone without any prior knowledge. For me too I have tried to explain
        many times something to one of my friends with no knowledge but they
        either didn’t seem to care or understand at all. So, I’m making this
        article to explain what each computer part does, how to pick them and
        how to build a PC.
      </p>

      <p>Here are the following things you will need to know to build a PC:</p>

      <li>Operating system(OS)</li>
      <li>CPU(Central Processing Unit)</li>
      <li>Graphics processing unit (GPU)</li>
      <li>RAM(Memory)</li>
      <li>Storage</li>
      <li>Power supply unit (PSU)</li>
      <li>Gaming peripherals</li>

      <p>
        Let's take a glance at what each component does, why it is necessary , and
        what you would like to seem for while shopping around.
      </p>

      <h1>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h1>

      <p>
        The CPU, also named as the processor, is basically the brain of your PC. When
        a computer program runs, it sends a list of tasks (which are actually more like
        instructions) to the processor. The CPU performs each task and sends signals
        to other components to let them know what they need to perform to fulfil
        that task.
        
        There are two main metrics that will help choosing the right CPU for your
        needs: Core count and core clock speed.
        Core count tells us how many processors the CPU has — otherwise, how many
        tasks the CPU can perform simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Core Clock speed indicates how quickly the CPU is performing each task.
      </p>

      <h1>Motherboard(Mobo)</h1>

      <p>
        The motherboard (commonly called Mobo) is that the main circuit card/board
        and is connected to everything. The CPU sits directly on the motherboard
        (your CPU and motherboard must be compatible for the computer to work)
        and each other components graphics cards, hard drives, memory, optical
        drives, wireless cards integrates into the motherboard.
        One way to simplify it is to shop by size and socket. The most common form
        factors are Extended ATX, ATX, microATX, and Mini-ITX. Socket size is
        even more important than the size of the motherboard since that is where
        your CPU will sit in so make sure it is the right size.
      </p>

      <h1>Memory (RAM)</h1>

      <p>
        Random Access Memory (RAM) is your PC's STM(short term memory) . It's
        faster and easier to access than your PC's LTM(long term memory) .
        Main things to look for in RAM is space and speed (very commonly measured
        as MHz). These two are very important when picking RAM
        tip: you should also see if they are compatible with your CPU since they can
        take up a certain speed and space of RAM.
        Tip: if you take higher MHz then your CPU can take you can change it in you
        BIOS settings but I advise you to ask an expert how to do it first.
      </p>

      <h1>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h1>

      <p>
        There are two types of graphics processors: Integrated and discrete.
        Integrated graphics processors are integrated with the CPU. Integrated
        graphics have improved significantly throughout the years, though they are
        still generally less powerful than discrete graphics.
        
        Discrete graphics are much bigger and more powerful than Integrated
        graphics, they plug into the motherboard via PCIe, and come with their own
        stratifications, including video memory and an active cooling system(you can
        change the cooling later if you are looking into overclocking your GPU, do not
        attempt without expert supervision) . A discrete graphics card is a must-have
        for gamers who play any of today's demanding, graphics-heavy games. Serious
        gamers will want to look for graphics cards that produce consistent frame
        rates of at least 60 frames per second (FPS) at your desired resolution
        (anything lower may look choppy), while gamers looking to play in virtual
        reality should look for cards that produce consistent frame rates of at least
        90 fps.
        Tip: The GPU isn't the only component that affects frame rate, so it's
        important to balance out your build or you'll run into performance bottlenecks
        elsewhere.
      </p>

      <h1>Power Suply Unit (PSU)</h1>

      <p>
        Selecting a power supply unit (PSU) is a critical step in any build. The PSU
        needs to be well-made and powerful enough to handle all current and future
        components, and it doesn't hurt to have a warranty.
        PSUs come in non-modular, semi-modular, and full-modular styles.
        Full-modular PSUs are even easier to work with than semi-modular PSUs, but
        the added convenience usually comes shouldered with a higher cost.
        Non-modular PSUs have all cables permanently attached. This is the
        cheapest option, but you'll need to find a place to store all the cables that
        you know you’re not going to use. Too many unused cables result in poor cable
        management, which can obstruct airflow and end up affecting your PC's
        performance.
        Semi-modular PSUs are the best option for most people. These units come
        with a handful of essential cables attached and are cheaper than full-modular
        styles.
      </p>

      <h1>Storage: Solid-State Drives (SSDs), Hard Disk Drives
        (HDDs)</h1>

      <p>
        There are two main types of storage: Solid-state drives (SSDs)and hard disk
        drives (HDDs). There are pros and cons to choosing either an SSD or HDD,
        though the good news is that you don't have to choose just one.
        HDDs store data on a spinning plate. These plates use magnetic material to
        store data, which is subsequently retrieved using a mechanical arm.
        HDDs come in two form factors:
        
        3.5 inches, they are more common in desktops spinning at faster rates,
        often more than of 7200 RPM
        2.5 inches, which are more common in laptops and usually spin at a rate of
        5400 RPM (revolutions per minute)
        SSDs use NAND-based flash memory — similar to, but faster and more
        reliable than the flash memory used in a USB flash drive — to store data. In
        lieu of a mechanical arm, they use integrated processors to access stored
        data, making them much faster and less prone to mechanical failure than
        HDDs. The speed and convenience of SSDs come at a cost, however; SSDs
        are more expensive per gigabyte than HDDs.
        Modern SSDs come in two protocols:
        Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe), it uses the PCI Express interface
        achieving higher performance
        Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), it is the older protocol of
        the two, operating with higher latency and lower peak bandwidth.

      <h1>System Cooling, CPU Cooling and Chassis</h1>

      <p>
        There are two main ways to cool down your PC: Air cooling and liquid cooling.

        Air cooling uses fans to funnel hot air through your system and far from
        components to stop overheating. The benefits of air cooling are cost and are
        easily installable (fans are smaller and easier to fit inside a crowded chassis).
        The biggest drawback to air cooling is its limitations: Air cooling depends on
        efficient airflow inside the case to maneuver hot air far away from
        components, so any airflow restriction can be problematic.
        Liquid cooling uses a liquid coolant (such deionized water) to absorb heat
        from components and move it to a part that's less restricted (where the
        radiator is placed). Liquid cooling is less dependent on airflow inside the
        chassis, and thus more efficient at cooling specific components. The downside
        to liquid cooling is that liquid cooling systems are contained, which implies
        they're usually larger and tougher to put in than a typical air-cooled setup
        (they're also more expensive).
        In addition to general system cooling, you'll also need to purchase a dedicated
        CPU cooler(if the CPU did not come with a stock cooler). CPU coolers are
        available in both air and liquid form factors and mount directly onto your CPU.
        When buying a CPU cooler, it is vital to make sure it's compatible along with
        your CPU and sized to suit your build.
        Pro-tip: In an air-cooled system, more fans doesn't necessarily mean better
        cooling. Fan quality and placement make a difference.
      </p>

      <h1>Gaming Peripherals</h1>

      <p>
        Monitors, keyboards, mice, headphones, and other peripherals mostly come
        right down to personal preference. You don’t have to purchase these things
        along with your components, but you will require need a display, a keyboard,
        and a mouse to set up your system after you build it.
        Important tip: You should always have in mind the balance of your build. Even
        if you have the best PC, but you're still using a 1080p, 60Hz monitor, you
        won't be taking full advantage of your hardware.
      </p>

      <h1>Operating System (OS)</h1>

      <p>
        Last but not least, you’ll have to prepare to put in an OS(operating system)

        once all the rest components are assembled within the case. An OS is a
        critical piece of software that assists in managing communications between a
        computer’s hardware and programs. You should prepare your PC’s OS ahead of
        time, determining which OS you want to install on your PC and download the
        installer on a USB flash drive.
        Last but not least, the case you don’t have to but it will help a lot when
        building a PC. Like the motherboard it is measured in Extended ATX, ATX,
        microATX, and Mini-ITX, this shows what size motherboard, how many fans it
        can fit and how they can be, how big radiator it fits if you are buying a liquid
        cooler, etc.
        with this information now you can buy compatible parts for your PC build or
        choose to go for a pre-built if it’s too much hassle for you.
      </p>

      <h1>Building the PC</h1>

      <p>
        First thing is the building place, you’ll need a:

        clear antistatic working station, 
        
        a Philips screw driver, 
        
        scissors and 
        
        zip ties.
      </p>


      <p>
        Once you got all that unpack the mother board and place
        it on the table, afterwards unpack the CPU and look for a
        golden arrow in one of the CPUs corners and match it up
        with the corner that stands out on the mobo, slowly insert
        it with minimal pushing.</p>
        
        <p>Now installing the RAM, it is placed based on what RAM and
         mobo you have bought whether you bought four sticks or
        two sticks of RAM you should see if your mobo supports
        dual-channel and quad-channel meaning the two/four sticks
        of RAM act as one.</p>
        
        
        <p> Next you will need to add thermal paste if your CPU cooler
        doesn’t have already.</p>
        
        <p>  You will only need to add a small amount enough to cover the
        whole surface of the CPU when you add the cooler.</p>
        
        <p> While inserting the cooler you need to line up the screws of
        the cooler with the holes of the motherboard, while
        screwing them you should screw them in a horizontal
        pattern little by little until it’s screwed.</p>
        

        <p>  Afterwards insert the motherboard with the I/O
        panel(contained in the motherboards box which it came
        with) as the following picture shows and screw it on the
        case(you shouldn’t screw them too tight, also the middle is
        optional so you don’t have to screw it).</p>
        
        <p> Plug in the case connectors. They are commonly located
        together on the motherboard near the front of the case.
        The order in which these are connected will depend on which
        is easiest. Make sure that you connect the Power, the USB
        ports and the LED power, Reset switches and hard drive
        lights, and the audio cable. Your motherboard’s information
        will show you where on your motherboard these connectors
        attach.</p>
        
        <p> Tip: There is only one place that the connectors
        can attach to the motherboard. Don’t try to force
        anything to fit.</p>
        
        <p> Install your hard drive
        This process will vary slightly depending on your case, but
        you should follow these basic steps.</p>
        
        <p> Insert the hard drive into its slot (if it has
        one).
        Tighten any screws needed to hold the drive in
        place.
        Plug the hard drive's SATA cable into the
        SATA slot on the motherboard.</p>
        
        <p> If you haven't already connected the power supply to your
        components which need power, you must make sure that it is
        connected to the following locations:</p>
        
        GPU(s), 
        Hard drive(s), 
        
        Motherboard.
        
        
        <p> Once you've placed and connected the various internal
        components for your computer, all that's left to do is
        ensure that none of the wires interfere with circulation and
        close up the case.
        Many cases will have panels which either slide back into
        place or screws onto the side of the case.
        If you bought a cooling system, you'll want to install it
        before you proceed. Refer to the cooling system's
        installation instructions in order to do so.
        Now your PC is ready you just have to connect all the
        peripherals cables, the PC power, the monitor
        
        ’s power,
        and the display from the pc to the monitor. All you
        need to do now is download your preferred
        OS(operating system), when you are done you
        
        ’ll have
        to download your GPU, BIOS(it is not necessary) and
        CPU drivers.
        After all this journey, you have learned what each and
        every PC component does and even built one with that
        knowledge. I hoped you learned something from this
        experience and in the next time you will be helping
        someone else at building a PC. </p>
