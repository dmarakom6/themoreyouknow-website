      <p>
        Since the covid-19 pandemic began, our lives have undergone major
        changes and now our new reality differs dramatically from the past one.
        Will our lives ever be the same or will we have to adjust to the new
        normal and never look back? We are all dying of curiosity to learn the
        answer to this question, however only time will tell. In the meantime,
        an analysis has been made on how covid has affected the fields of
        education, entertainment, technology, working conditions, as well as
        shopping.
      </p>

      <h1>Education</h1>

      <p>
        When covid-19 struck and it was no longer safe to attend school in
        person a new means of educating people had to be found. This is how we
        came up with online classes and even though they are obviously not the
        ideal way of acquiring knowledge, we can at least continue being taught
        despite the difficult circumstances. Most of us believe that e-learning
        is a temporary situation, however is this the case? Since this new
        school method appeared, a new era on education began. Children who live
        on remote locations, where there are no nearby schools, now have access
        to education provided that they have an electronic device. In addition,
        university/college students, who wish to attend foreign institutions but
        do not have the money required to start a new life there, can do their
        studies from home. Furthermore, whenever there are dangerous weather
        conditions or when it is the season of diseases, students can still get
        on with their material, while being safe under their own roof. Moreover,
        a new international school system will possibly be developed, which
        could be attended by students from all around the world, who will be
        united by technology.

      <h2>Deliveries</h2>

      <p>
        During the period of quarantine, e-shopping rose nearly 60% and as a
        result there was a sudden need for new ways of performing quick
        deliveries and to serve this purpose various start-ups were created. A
        case in point is drone deliveries. Especially in the case of restaurants
        and cafes, where the distance from the store to the house is usually
        short, drones avoid traffic or any other distraction and bring the goods
        quickly and efficiently.
      </p>

      <h2>Autonomous in-store shopping</h2>

      <p>
        Major US retailers and e-commerce giants, such as Amazon have prototyped
        once again and created stores, where consumers can enter, select their
        products, put them in their basket, check out, pay via their smartphone
        and walk out without having had any human interaction or waited in long
        ques. This is the future of in-store shopping.

      <h1>Biotechnology</h1>

      <img src="../src/lifeAfterCovid/biotechnology.jpg" />

      <p>
        A field which has played a core role during this pandemic, is
        biotechnology. Biotechnology is a combination of medicine-biology,
        technology and the basics of engineering. Some of the most significant
        achievements of this domain are the following: 1) gene editing, 2)3D
        bioprinting, 4)creation of artificial organs, 5)biosensors. Biotech
        developed really quickly this period, making it possible to have
        vaccines with over 90% efficacy in the span of 10 months instead of 10
        years.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>
        Vladimir Lenin is often quoted as saying, “There are
        decades when nothing happens and there are weeks were
        decades happen”. In our case, this pandemic might have
        had various adverse effects on many domains, however it
        has also caused the acceleration of a plethora of
        innovations and technologies.
