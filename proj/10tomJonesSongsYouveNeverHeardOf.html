        <h1 id="read">Introduction</h1>
    
        <p>Everyone knows <b>Sir Tom Jones</b>. He's been offering the world his astounding music since the 1960s.
          His performing range has included pop, swing, R&B, country, even gospel. The whole world admires his talent and style of music since the very
          beginning of his career. However, many of his songs remain almost unknown by his audience.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The artist has a copious amount of albums and songs; <b>40 studio albums, 5 Live albums and over 100 singles</b>, as well as an impressive
          amount of work sold all around the globe - Jones has sold over 100 million records with thirty-six Top 40 hits in the United Kingdom and nineteen in the United States, including "It's Not Unusual", "What's New Pussycat", "Delilah", "Green, Green Grass of Home", "She's a Lady", "Kiss", and "Sex Bomb".
          He was also rewarded with Grammy and Brit Awards multiple times in his career. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Without further ado, let's jump in <b>the Top 10 Tom Jones you've never heard of</b> (probably).
        </p>
    
        <h1>10. "Memphis, Tennessee"</h1>

        <p>In this classic Rock and Roll song, Jones talks about his beloved girl Marie, who lives far away from him, in Memphis. He tries to come in touch with her, but
          his family won't let him. He seems desperate and wants to talk to her at all costs. A really romantic, yet spine-tingling song.
        </p>

        <h1>9. "Day By Day"</h1>

        <p>In the first song of "Help Yourself", Jones is shy about talking to a woman he just fell in love with.
          His love for her is getting bigger <b>Day By Day</b>, but he prefers to hide his feelings. Poor, poor Tom.
        </p>
    
        <h1>8. "Lean On Me"</h1>

        <p>
          In "Lean on Me", Jones uses his full-throated, robust baritone voice to help us carry on with our lives.
          He gives his audience advice on dealing with problems and sharing their thoughts. An encouraging song for the hard times.
        </p>

        <h1>7. "Hello Young Lovers"</h1>

        <p>
          This time, Tom Jones helps us to deal with our first date. Being in love like us before, he gives us his advice on loving and being loved.
          We should be "brave, faithful and true" with the person we love.
          At the end of this beautiful romantic song,
          Tom tells us not to cry if anything goes wrong, and wishes us good luck. Should we trust him?
        </p>
        
        <h1>6. "Stop Breaking My Heart"</h1>

        <p>
          Here, Jones begs his woman to return to him. He's sure he can't live without her, and he won't let her love someone else.
          So, he wants her to stop breaking his heart and come back home. He sounds tired but he still has hope that she will forgive him. But, will her?
        </p>

        <h1>5. "Bring It On Home"</h1>

        <p>
          In this shrilly monotonous but powerful song, Jones is coming back home to his beloved woman, tired and exhausted from work. He describes his emotions when he gets on the train home, and he can't wait to see her.
          Another thought is that Jones is coming back from a war.
        </p>

        <h1>4. "Laura"</h1>

        <p>
          Jones talks to his girl, Laura, who he describes as beautiful and sweet. He realizes that Laura has fallen in love with another man. He can't stand this unfair one-sided love, so he asks her "What's he got that I ain't got?". He even threatened her with commiting suicide!
        </p>

        <h1>3. "Try A Little Tenderness"</h1>

        <p>
          Again, Jones teaches us to be patient with women. Even though they seem like they don't care about us, we should <b>try a little tenderness</b>.
          Roughly 3 minutes into the song, Jones will get mad and won't stop telling us to <b>never stop trying</b>.
        </p>

        <h1>2. "Sugar Sugar"</h1>

        <p>
          Maybe you know this song, but did you know that Tom Jones sang it too? In addition, his amazing voice makes it sound more eager and melodious.
          This was the #1 song of 1969 in the US, according to Billboard's year-end chart, beating out songs by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Jackson 5, Elvis Presley, David Bowie, and Stevie Wonder!
        </p>

        <h1>1. "If I Only Knew"</h1>

        <p>
          Almost nobody has ever heard of "<b>If I Only Knew</b>". However, it might as well be <b>one of the best Tom Jones songs</b> ever.
          It's so sweet yet still funky, which makes it incomparable to the other songs in this list. It's all about a girl he met and wanted to make her love him,
          but didn't know how. He says: "If I only knew, what I should do, I'd make you love me". The melody and rhythm constantly changes throughout this marvellous 4-minute
          song. If you've never heard of Tom Jones before, shame on you, but I would highly recommend checking this one out first.
        </p>


        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>
          So that's it for your <b>Top 10 Tom Jones songs you've never heard of</b>. Of course, every song is a masterpiece on its own, but songs that come and go
          unnoticed, especially from artists like <b>Tom Jones</b>, should be known from all of us.
        </p>

        <p>
          How many of these did <b>you</b> know?
